# DX7_encoder
One day friend of mine asked me if it's possible to improve his old Spektrum DX7
in a way that hi could tune parameters with rotary encoder instead of usual keys. I answered that it's possible.
Here is a program for ATTiny45 MCU which reliably reads the quadrature encoder and generates accurate pulses for keys.
